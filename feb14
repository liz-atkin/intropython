#you'll need to explicitly convert the types of your variables. More specifically, you'll need str(), to convert a value into a string. 
#str(savings), for example, will convert the integer savings to a string.

#Similar functions such as int(), float() and bool() will help you convert Python values into any type

savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

pi_string = "3.1415926"
# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float=float(pi_string)

#build a list with []

#[[],[],[]] works
#first index is list[0], last one is list[-1]

# fam[3:5] includes index 3 and 4, NOT 5. inclusive:exclusive

# downstairs=areas[0:6] this is the First Six Elements
# upstairs=areas[-4:] this is the Last Four Elements

x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
x[:2]
x[2:]
x[:]

#there is list x. make y=x. change y[1]. x[1] changes too
# to make this not happen, do y=list(x) or y=x[:]

#delete elements with del(x[1]) then the rest of the indexes change

The ; sign is used to place commands on the same line. The following two code chunks are equivalent:
# Same line
command1; command2

# Separate lines
command1
command2

#call methods on different python objects with dot notation, like areas.index(xyz) or areas.count("o")
#remember to print

#areas.reverse() reverses areas. remember dot notation

# install and import numpy. then call functions numpy.array([1,2,3]). if u import as np, then np.array
